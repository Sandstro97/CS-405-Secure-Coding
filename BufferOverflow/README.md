Prompt

This assignment presents code that collects a number from the user and then displays the number and a secret account number. Entering too many characters triggers the overwrite of the account number. Using the existing source code as a starting point, you need to prevent the user input from impacting the account number.

The source code has been commented using TODO to explain the detailed rules you must follow.
There may be more than one way to solve this problem. It is key to demonstrate that your implementation prevents the users from modifying the account number through entering too much data.
Do not forget that you can leverage capabilities provided by the standard C++ library to help you achieve success.
Please comment on any changes you make in the code to explain the logic, formulas, or data types you are adding. You will also create a brief written summary of the approach taken, why it will stop the overflow, any issues you encountered, and how you resolved those issues.

Specifically, you will prepare the following:

Buffer overflow defensive coding solutions
C/C++ program functionality and best practices
A summary of your process in a Word document that contains a screenshot of the application console output
To complete this assignment, download the Buffer Overflow source code files ZIP to use as guidance as you move through the activity. You will use your development environment to complete this activity.
