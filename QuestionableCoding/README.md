Prompt

You will learn to do the following:

Use a static analysis tool to find coding errors
Apply your understanding of the types of errors that can be found through tooling
Specifically, address the following in a static testing summary:

Static Code Analysis: Complete the static code analysis activity by successfully identifying the issues in the supplied code, comparing the code against the built-in analysis of Visual Studio, providing the XML output from Cppcheck, and providing a screenshot from Visual Studio. Analyze a source code project using a static code analysis to understand the different types of messages, their respective risks, and proposed solutions produced by using static code analysis. Plan to compare the messages produced by Visual Studio and Cppcheck, and learn the limitations and benefits of each.
Process Summary: Provide a thorough and systematic summary of the Cppcheck static code analysis compared against Visual Studioâ€™s analysis, and include specific differences between the two. Determine the risk, provide a description of the issue, and explain how to mitigate the code vulnerability. Include information about all of the issues not specifically identified by Cppcheck and Visual Studio. For each issue, identify which tool (Cppcheck or Visual Studio) found the issue.
To complete this assignment, download the Questionable source code file to use as guidance as you move through the activity. You will use your development environment to complete this activity.
